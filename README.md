# Esh blog home assignment

For saving time I used my infra template which includes: Vite + TypeScript + ESLint + React + React-Router-DOM 6


Added responsive ui functionality, animations, multi-language support using react-i18next

Note: Blog posts are stored in the assets directory ad dummy posts

## Available npm scripts:
`npm run dev`
`npm run build`
