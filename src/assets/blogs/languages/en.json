The unique platform developed by the technology company esh OS, is an alternative to the outdated core system used in banks today, and enables for the first time, a complete end-to-end banking services platform - all bank systems under one modular system. This is not only about a revolutionary technological change, but also a change in perception for all of us - from bankers to customers."
